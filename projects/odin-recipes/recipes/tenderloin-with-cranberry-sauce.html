                <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
                <p>A rich and savoury tenderloin with a bright dressing of delicate Cranberry sauce. This main dish is easily paired
                    with most greens, buttered rolls and a glass of your favorite vintage. Be sure your tenderloin comes
                    from a kill with an excellent diet to maximize the flavor potential. Pro-Tip: Make the first part of the 
                    cranberry sauce ahead of time as it can take longer than the loin does to cook to ensure the perfect resting time
                    for the loin.
                </p>

                <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
                    <p>For the Loin:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rinse your loin and pat dry. Trim any necessary excess fat there might be, depending on the fitness level 
                            of your kill.</li>
                        <li>Salt and generouly pepper the loin, turning to ensure proper seasoning.</li>
                        <li>Heat the olive oil and the butter in a cast iron pan on medium heat. </li>
                        <li>Brown the loin on all sides in the pan to sear, then place the whole pan into a 400 degree pre-heated 
                            oven until a meat thermometer reads 155 degrees, about 15 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK!
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove loin and loosely cover with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes while collecting plates and ensuring
                            cranberry sauce is ready.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>For the Cranberry Sauce (Prep first part ahead of time for easier prep):</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine the cranberries, sugar, water and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until 
                            all berries pop and the mixure has thickened considerably, but still runs off a spoon easily (abt. 20m).
                        </li>
                        <li>Saute the onion and about a tablespoon of the Rosemary on medium heat in the butter until fragrant and the onion is a golden color.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the wine and reduce down to half the amount of liquid.</li>
                        <li>Add the bone broth, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Into your onion mixure, add your cranberry mixture. Combine thoroughly, and simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Place the entire mixure in a blender and puree until smooth. If too thick, you can thin it by adding a small amount of red wine.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Plate the dish by thinly slicing the tenderloin and offer between 2 and 4 slices on each plate. Use a large spoonful 
                        of cranberry sauce as the base, then lay the slice on the place slighly overlapping. Top with more sauce, and garnish with
                        a sprig of Rosemary. Enjoy with your favorite vintage and side of greens.
