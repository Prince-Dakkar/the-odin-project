                <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
                <p>A simple, but electrifying charcuterie board with enough variety to wow the most refined palate. Whip one of these up and consider your prep for the early 
                    evening complete, leaving you to mingle with your guests and spend more time picking the perfect quarry. Pair with a light vintage for an even more elegant feel.
                </p>
                <p>We give a list of possible additions. However, a Charcuterie Board is a personal choice, and should reflect YOU. Feel free to omit or add at your discretion.</p>

                        <li>A clean, medium sized ribcage for the centerpiece (we advise against using usual quarry since most guests have some medical knowledge)</li>

                        <li>Dried and Fresh Figs</li>
                        <li>Small Citrus fruits like Kumquats, Mandarins, Tangerines and Finger Limes</li>
                        <li> A selection of good quality crackers</li>
                        <li>A selection of your favorite salty and blue cheeses</li>
                        <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                        <li>Green Olives</li>
                        <li>Green Olives</li>
                        <li>Assortments of nuts and dried fruits</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
                <p>Simply procure a board or tasteful tray to contain the charcuterie, and build the board from the bottom up
                    by first placing the rib cage, then arranging from the ribcage out to the edges of the board. Remember to keep like colors 
                    apart as balanced as possible, while also balancing the flavors of the board.
